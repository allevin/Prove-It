    "An `Expression` object must be one of the \"core\" `Expression` classes listed below that is each derived from `proveit._core_.expression.expr.Expression`.  The list is reproduced from our <a class=\"ProveItLink\" href=\"../packages/brief_guide.ipynb\">brief guide</a> but more details and some code examples are provided below in this tutorial.  The \"basic\" types of expressions that are covered in this chapter are:\n",
    "* <a href=\"#Variable\">`Variable`</a>: A label that is interchangeable (as long as it is kept distinct from other labels) with no intrinsic meaning.  It is usually represented by a single letter but can have any representation.\n",
    "* <a href=\"#Literal\">`Literal`</a>: A label that is not interchangeable and has an intrinsic meaning.  Specific operators ($\\lnot, \\land, +, \\times$, etc.) and specific irreducibe values ($\\top, \\bot, 0, 5$, etc.) are all `Literal`s.  Furthermore, a problem-story `Variable` in a particular **context**, representing some unknown but particular value, should also be a `Literal` (e.g., \"Ann has $a$ apples...\").\n",
    "* <a href=\"#Operation\">`Operation`</a>: The application of *operator(s)* on *operand(s)*.  For example, $0 + 5 + 8$ and $1 < a \\leq b < 3$ are examples of *operation* expressions.  The **Prove-It** library defines many *types* derived from the *operation* type (e.g., for each specific operation), but the <a href=\"#proof_deriv\">derivation rules</a> only need to know that these are *operations*.\n",
    "* <a href=\"#Lambda\">`Lambda`</a>: A mapping defined by *parameter* `Variable`s transforming to some *body* `Expression` but only when the *parameter(s)* meet certain *condition(s)*.  For example, $(x, y, z) \\mapsto x+y/z~|~x \\in \\mathbb{R}, y \\in \\mathbb{R}, z \\in \\mathbb{R}, z \\neq 0$ is a conditional **lambda** that converts three real numbers $x, y, z$ to $x + y/z$ as long as $z$ is not zero.  Note that a `Lambda` introduces `Variables` into a new scope via the *parameters*.  These *parameter* `Variable`s are said to be *bound* in this new scope; occurrences outside this scope are not deemed to be the same thing. There is a special category of `Operation` types called `OperationOverInstances` that are essentially functionals acting on a `Lambda` operand.  $\\forall$, $\\exists$, $\\sum$, and $\\prod$ are examples of `OperationOverInstances`.  For example, $\\forall_{x~|~Q(x)} P(x)$ is an expression that translates to \"$P(x)$ is true for all values of $x$ for which $Q(x)$ is also true\".  Internally, this is represented as an $\\forall$ operator acting on the conditional `Lambda` map $x \\mapsto P(x)~|~Q(x)$.\n",
    "* <a href=\"#ExprList\">`ExprList`</a>: A list of `Expression`s that is used, for example, when there are multiple *operators* or *operands* of an `Operation` or multiple *parameters* of a `Lambda`.\n",
    "* <a href=\"#NamedExprs\">`NamedExprs`</a>: A mapping from keyword strings to `Expression`s.  This can be used to prevent ambiguity of an expression's internal representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advanced expressions covered in a <a href=\"tutorial10_advanced_expr.ipynb\">later chapter</a>:\n",
    "* <a href=\"tutorial10_advanced_expr.ipynb#ExprTensor\">`ExprTensor`</a>: A multi-dimensional (e.g., two-dimensional) array of `Expression`s. This can be used, for example, to represent a quantum circuit which is a two-dimensional graphical representation of a sequence of quantum operations.  A 2-D representation of a matrix is a more basic example.  More work is required to properly implement and test the *ExprTensor* class.\n",
    "* <a href=\"tutorial10_advanced_expr.ipynb#Indexed\">`Indexed`</a>: A particular indexed element of a `Variable` where the `Variable` is intended to serve as a placeholder for an `ExprList` or `ExprTensor`.  It has a *base* which determines the indexing offset, typically $0$ or $1$.  For example, $x_5$ represents the fifth or sixth element of $x$ in *base* $1$ or $0$ respectively.  The *base* is typically not displayed and must be inferred by the context, though it is explicitly revealed in the <a href=\"#expr_info\">expression information page</a>.  An `Indexed` expression is typically contained within an `Iter` (described next).\n",
    "* <a href=\"tutorial10_advanced_expr.ipynb#Iter\">`Iter`</a>: Represents an iteration of a *parameter* going from a *start* to an *end* in successive unit increments ($+1$).  For example, $x_1 +~\\ldots~+ x_n$ contains an `Iter` of `Indexed` `Variable`.  If we take $n$ to be $3$, this would expand to $x_1 + x_2 + x_3$.  An `Iter` has a *lambda map*, *start index(indices)*, and *end index(indices)*.  In our example, the `Iter` $x_1,~\\ldots,x_n$, is the *operand* of an `proveit.number.addition.Add` `Operation`.  The *lambda map*, *start index* and *end index* of the *iteration* are $i \\mapsto x_i$, $1$, and $n$, respectively.\n"

Users are advised to inspect the fully explicit expression DAGs of important axioms and theorems (or rely on crowdsource checking).

This creates a new `Expression` but has nothing to do, intrinsically, with proving statements.\n",
    "* *Expression relabeling*: a restricted version of *expression substitution* in which any `Variable` may be relabeled only with another `Variable` by using the `relabeled` method.\n",
    "* *Specialization* derivation step: deriving a statement of the form $P(y)$ from a statement of the form $\\forall_x P(x)$.  Details of this will be discussed in a later tutorial chapter, but this manipulation uses *expression substitution* in generating $P(y)$.  However, specific rules and limitations apply to *specialization* that may not apply to *expression substitution* to ensure that the derivation is sound.  *Specialization* specifically involves statements (**known truths**) with the $\\forall$ quantifier (Forall).\n",
    "* *Relabeling* derivation step: deriving a statement (known truth) from another statement which differs only in its `Variable`s.  For example, from $\\forall_x P(x)$, we could use *relabeling* to derive $\\forall_y P(y)$.\n",
    "* *Equality substitution*: using the `substitution` axiom of `proveit.logic.equality` to prove that $f(x) = f(y)$ given $x = y$.  This uses *specialization* of the `substitution` axiom which state $\\forall_{f, x, y~|~x=y}~(f(x) = f(y))$.

These advanced expressions allow multi-dimensional representations of mathematical structure (for example, explicit matrix representations or quantum circuits) via the <a href=\"tutorial10_advanced_expr.ipynb#ExprT?ensor\">`ExprTensor`</a> type as well as iterated ranges within lists or tensors via the <a href=\"tutorial10_advanced_expr.ipynb#ExprTensor\">`Iter`</a> type (e.g., $x_1 +~\\ldots~+ x_n$).  These advanced expression types are useful in forming explicit representations commonly used to communicate mathematical concepts.  They are not necessary, however, in general theorem proving.  One could choose not to use such constructs and only represent such concepts via implicit representations and recursion.  Following the **Prove-It** philosophy, however, we want to allow the use of explicit representation tied as directly as possible into our formal proofs.  But we will skip these for now so we can cover our theorem proving concepts without this extra complication."
