        Last modified: 3/28/2020 by wdc. Creation. Based on roughly
                       analogous methods in Add and Exp classes. May
                       need to be renamed.

        For the trivial case where the operand is an integer,
        derive and return this Round expression equated with the
        operand itself. Assumptions may be necessary to deduce
        necessary conditions for the simplification.
        For the case where the operand is of the form (real + int),
        derive and return this Round expression equated with
        Round(real) + int.
        CONSIDER ADDING A RECURSIVE COMPONENT to allow further 
        simplfication, for example for Round(real + int + int).
