"""
A TransitiveRelation is a generic base class for binary
relationships that are transitive.  Less than and greater than
relationships are examples (so are subset and superset relationships).
For example, transitivity in the "less than" context means that 
a<b and b<c implies that a<c.  Equality (proveit.logic.Equals) is
special kind of TransitiveRelation that is alsy symmetric; that is,
y=x if x=y.  proveit.logic.Equals is a TransitiveRelation, but
overloads the default methods.  The TransitiveRelation class
provides convenient automation capabilities for performing
a transitive search to conclude a new relation from known relations
using transitivity rules.  To enable this, each TransitiveRelation
needs to track to define knownLeftSides and knownRightSides as
class dictionaries; these will be populated as side effects for
each proven relation (see deriveSideEffects).  Also, the
applyTransitivity method should be appropriately implemented.
The default version handles the case when the "other" relation
is an equality (in which case, substitution may simply be performed).

        Using the given known transitivity relations (from the left and from the right)
        and the given assumptions, return the items in sorted order according to the transitivity
        relations, proven as a KnownTruth.  If there is not enough information to sort
        the items, a ProofFailure will be raised.  Also, if there are transitivity cycles 
        between items that are not identified as equivalences, a TransitivityException is raised;
        for example, if a <= b, b <= c, and c <= a, then a=b and b=c (or a=c) should be proven
        before calling this sorting routine.
        
        For n items, the performance is O(n log n) when the only known relationships involving the
        items are the necessary, non-redundant relationship between them.  When there are
        extra intermediate relationships, a meet-in-the-middle search is employed (like
        _transitivitySearch except the searches are performed in parallel).  The worst-case
        time complexity, beyond the overhead of meet-in-the-middle searches for extra intermediate
        relationships, is O(n^2 log n) which can occur when the n^2 relationships between the items
