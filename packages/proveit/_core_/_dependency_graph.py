'''
A dependency graph is a directed acyclic graph of dependency relationships.
A Proof is a dependency graph of derivations steps.  An Expression is
also a sort of dependency graph where the expression "depends" upon
sub-expressions.  The inverse relationship of a dependency is a requirement.

    '''
    Given a "root node" of a directed acyclic graph and a function
    that returns the "requirements" of a node (the node "depends" upon
    its requirements), returns a list of the "nodes" that includes
    the root node and all nodes which the root node depends upon, directly
    or indirectly.  The list will be ordered in such a way that each node
    will only depend upon nodes that come later in the list (the root node
    will necessarily come first).
